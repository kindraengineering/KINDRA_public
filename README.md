# KINDRA Public Repository
## Introduction


Welcome to KINDRA!




### About KINDRA
KINDRA is an implementation of a low-cost UAV air monitoring system designed by students from the Department of Engineering, King's College London.

Here you will find the prior resources used by the project group.

This project is a collaboration between the Department of Engineering, Faculty of Natural and Mathematical Sciences and the Department of Geography, Faculty of Social Science and Public Policy of King's College London.

### Intended Use
KINDRA is currently in the developmental stages. The product should be used for educational purposes and non-commercial use.
